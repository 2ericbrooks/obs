Presidents Day (2024-02-19)

Today I woke up around 10:00 am and made breakfast for Petra and me. Gluten-free pancakes, coffee, and tea. Maple syrup, or Nutella and jam. I had it both ways. 

After I went and picked up the pair of Birkenstock sandals that I bought Petra for her birthday from REI on Westheimer. Her birthday is coming up this Wednesday, and I am amassing a small hill of gifts for her, not only because I love her but also because I feel bad for the truly awful gifts that the rest of my family gave her during our combined birthday get-together to celebrate Petra's birthday early and my sister's birthday belatedly.
